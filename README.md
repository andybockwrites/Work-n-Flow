# Work n' Flow: A Calendar App For Work Days

## Description

For the Fifth Module Challenge in my coding boot camp, I was tasked with building calendar app that stores To-Do lists into different hour blocks of a work day.

The Acceptance Criteria is as follows:

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist


## Usage

When the user loads the page, they will see the current date and time along with color coded hour blocks: A red column for the current hour block, grey columns for hours that have passed, and green blocks for future hour blocks.

The user can input text into each hour block and click the save button on the right. The data will then be stored, and remain even after the user reloads the page.
